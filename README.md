# FIT5196: Assignment 1

This repository contains the work and materials for Assignment 1 of the FIT5196 unit (Data Wrangling).

## Structure

The assignment is divided into two tasks:

### Task 1: Parsing Raw Text Files
This task involves extracting data from semi-structured text files containing YouTube comments and transforming it into JSON format. The extracted data includes elements such as `rf-id` (a unique numerical ID) `last-update-date`, `conveyance-text` and many more.

### Task 2: Text Pre-Processing
This task focuses on converting the extracted text data into a numerical representation suitable for downstream modeling tasks. The numerical representation is essential for natural language processing (NLP) tasks and is achieved by pre-processing a set of YouTube comments.

The allowed libraries for Task 1 are `re`, `json`, and `pandas`, while Task 2 permits the use of all libraries.
